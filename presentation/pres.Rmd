## Background

Matrix contains pre-normalized expression values for 100 genes over 10 time points.  

```{r echo = F,out.width='50%'}
# a = read.table('C:/Users/lcqi/OneDrive/Desktop/Courses/introduction_to_data_science_for_BME/shiny_clustering/expression.txt',header = 1,row.names = 1)
# print(head(a))
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/lcqi/OneDrive/Desktop/Courses/introduction_to_data_science_for_BME/shiny_clustering/presentation/1.png')
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/lcqi/OneDrive/Desktop/Courses/introduction_to_data_science_for_BME/shiny_clustering/presentation/2.png')

```

Which genes show increasing expression and which genes show decreasing expression, and how did you determine this?


## Solutions

- K-means clustering: the centroids are computed by averaging the observations that were assigned to it (e.g., computing the 'mean' of the observations).

- Principal component analysis (PCA): minimize the sum of squared distances

```{r echo = F,out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/Users/lcqi/OneDrive/Desktop/Courses/introduction_to_data_science_for_BME/shiny_clustering/presentation/K-means_convergence.gif')
